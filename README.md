# Overview

This repository contains the following project:
* Game using Python with the Arcade library

[I-Learn Project Description](https://byui-cse.github.io/cse310-course/modules/team_project_description.html)

We wanted to design a software to help younger kids learn math and get excited about it. We decided on making a game where the interaction between the player and enemy is based around math problems that the user has to solve. In order to run this, from our source code, you will use the file titled, "Start_Game.py" and run it. Alternatively we also created an executable file that will run the game as well.
